# cs1050-privacyPolicies
Privacy policy analyzer for CS1050

"Tech Option:

Using at least five different privacy policies from well-known web sites, obtain the text for those policies and look at the length, complexity, and required reading level for those policies (the python package textstat can be of help here, although there are likely others). Write a short lab report (2-4 pages) on what you found, along with any patterns that you discovered. Include a section on your methodology, as well as a section saying what the results mean."
